# Python-Chatbot
Overview
This project focuses on building a basic text chatbot—one that runs in the terminal and does not use AI or machine learning. Instead, it utilizes rule-based logic to recognize specific keywords in user input and generate predefined responses.

Key Features
Replies based on keywords (rule-based system, not AI-driven)

Mimics how early chat systems operated

Designed to practice Python fundamentals such as string matching, conditionals, and loops

Project Requirements
Functionality
The chatbot must run in the terminal.

The user should be able to type any message.

The chatbot will scan user messages for particular keywords and reply accordingly.

If the input contains no known keywords, the chatbot should reply with a default message.

Example Behavior
User says: "hello"
Bot replies: "Hi there! How can I help you today?"

User says: "bye"
Bot replies: "Goodbye! Have a nice day."

User says: (unrecognized message)
Bot replies: "I'm not sure how to respond to that."

Concepts to Practice
Loops to keep the conversation going (handle continuous user input)

Conditionals to check for keyword matches and decide responses

String matching to search for keywords within user input

Summary Table
Component	Description
Chatbot Type	Rule-based (no AI/ML), keyword-matching
User Interaction	User types text, bot analyzes for responses
Example Keywords	"hello" → greeting; "bye" → farewell; default for unrecognized messages
Core Concepts	Loops, conditionals, string operations
Outcome	Practice foundational programming structures applied to a real-world chat simulation
